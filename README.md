# PlayHymn3
## A (very) simple service to stream hymns played by me

### History
A really long story about how this project came about..


### Usage
Have not figured out how to run with one command. More details later.


### Todo
- Right now client and server both run in their own Tomcat instance. Need to create a fat jar. Can I run these both from one Tomcat?
- Add fancy html (Bootstrap most likely candidate)
- fix popState in jQuery
- learn JPA or Hibernate or something else to tie hymn database
- add <audio> to html, query aforementioned db for hymn
- how to run this on heroku
